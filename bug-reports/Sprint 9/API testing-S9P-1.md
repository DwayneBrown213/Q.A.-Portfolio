## üìù Description

### **Precondition:**  
After starting the server, log into the API database.

### **Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Create courier login with a POST request using URL + /api/v1/courier, and valid request body.
2. Create an order with a POST request using URL + /api/v1/orders, and valid request body.
3. Accept the order with a PUT request using URL + /api/v1/orders/accept/:id, and the same id as the courier created in the request body.
4. Delete the courier with a DELETE request using URL + /api/v1/courier/:id, and the same id as the courier created in the request body.
5. Access the URL's API, and call the "Couriers Table" , and confirm the courier login is deleted.
6. Call the "Orders Table", and confirm the associated order is deleted.

### **Expected Result:**  
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{ ok: true }

Both courier info and associated orders deleted.
```
When using the "Removing a courier" endpoint to delete the courier's info, from the API‚Äôs database, linked orders from the respective courier are not deleted.
### **Actual Result:**  
```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{ ok: true } 
```
The courier info is delete from couriers table but associated orders still remain in Orders table.
